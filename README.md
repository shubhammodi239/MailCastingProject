                       Mail Casting System Report File



Objective-

User can send mails, receive mails and delete mails locally after getting logged in!



SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT
 Operating System		:	Windows 98/2000/ME/XP		
                   Software			:	Eclipse IDE



ABSTRACT :

This software is capable of developing java application using java MVC Model.. This project automatically generates Java source codes for the design designed by the user. On behalf of writing source codes for designing, this project uses design-oriented approach to develop applications easily. The design will produce Java source code as an output. The output source will be saved to the disk as a Java file. The file can be edited with other source editors or text editors.	This software also supports compilation, execution and debugging of the Java programs.  The errors will be displayed in a separate window. If the source file generates no errors, the program can be executed from this software and the output is displayed.



Objectives of the system
	Design a GUI Interface
	Generate Code on designing
	Compile and execute
	Option of viewing code in an outline format, with each open and close brace.
	Drag and Drop components from Toolbox
	Customizable and extensible click to add mechanism, so that one can generate more than just the elements the IDE developer thought about.	These patterns include methods that address:
•	Visibility (protocol, package, protected, private)
•	Volatility (transient, persistent)
•	Initialization (eager, lazy)
•	Instantiation (Create, Load)
	Automatically add Skeleton methods when adding an interface to a class.

Project Model:

This project is based on mvc model .

Model–view–controller (usually known as MVC) is a software design pattern[1] commonly used for developing user interfaces which divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.[2][3] This kind of pattern is used for designing the layout of the page.

Traditionally used for desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs), this pattern has become popular for designing web applications.[4] Popular programming languages like JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, C#, and Swift have MVC frameworks that are used for web or mobile application development straight out of the box.


MY	Project is fully based on MVC model

Technologies I use in this project is:

At view level I use :- jsp,css.html

At controller level I use: jsp,Servlets

At Model level I use:- Hibernate Frameworks , mysql



Tools to be used


1.	Use any IDE to develop the project. I use  Eclipse.

2.	Hibernate ORM  for the database.

3.	Server: Apache Tomcat

Conclusion
This project so called IDE in java is mainly developed to reduce the manual work of the user. The java is not an easy tool to develop  a designing work. So  to make it as easy and user friendly, we created it. The code for the design  is automatically generated for the designed frame of the user. The time consumption of  the designing in JAVA is much reduced. The beginners of java also can develop some user interface design using our IDE.
